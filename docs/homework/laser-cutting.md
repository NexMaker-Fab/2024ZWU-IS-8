<h1 style="color: #e19cab;">Laser cutting</h1>

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Laser cutting is an efficient and accurate processing method, but due to the use of high-energy laser beams, there may be certain dangers to the operator and the surrounding environment.</h2>

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)</h3>

Goggles: Wear appropriate laser goggles to protect your eyes from laser radiation.

Protective gloves: to prevent accidental cutting or burns during operation.

Protective clothing: Wear high-temperature and fire-resistant work clothes to reduce laser reflection and splash damage.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Equipment safety measures</h3>

Laser shield: Ensure that the laser cutting machine is equipped with an appropriate shield to prevent the leakage of the laser beam.

Emergency shutdown button: Ensure that the equipment has an easy-to-operate emergency shutdown button to facilitate the immediate shutdown of the equipment in an emergency.

Smoke exhaust system: Install an effective smoke exhaust and ventilation system to remove smoke and harmful gases generated during the cutting process.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3. Operating instructions</h3>

Training and certification: Operators should receive professional training and understand the correct operation methods and safety precautions of laser cutting machines.

Program settings: Strictly follow the operation manual provided by the equipment manufacturer to avoid unauthorised settings changes.

Regular maintenance: regularly check and maintain the equipment to ensure that it is in good working condition and avoid safety accidents caused by equipment failure.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">4. Environmental safety</h3>

Fire prevention measures: Ensure that the working area is equipped with appropriate fire extinguishing equipment, such as fire extinguishers, and the operator understands how to use it.

Isolate dangerous areas: Set up a warning line or isolation area around the laser cutting machine to prevent unauthorised personnel from entering.

Ventilation and lighting: ensure good ventilation and lighting conditions so that the operator can clearly observe the cutting process.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">5. Processing and storing materials</h3>

Material safety: Use materials suitable for laser cutting to avoid cutting materials that may produce toxic gases or flammable substances.

Storage specifications: Properly store materials and waste to be cut to avoid messy stacking and fire hazards.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Different kind of material which can be manufacture by laser cutter</h2>

- Acrylic.
- Wood.
- Paper and Cardboard.
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Acrylic：</h3>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1.Preparation work:</h3>
Ensure that the laser cutter has been properly installed and calibrated, and that the light path and focal length are set correctly. Prepare the cutting parameters suitable for cutting acrylic, including power, speed, and depth of focus.Prepare a stable, scratch-free acrylic material.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2.To adjust the focus:</h3>
Make sure the focus of the laser head is properly adjusted to the acrylic surface. Typically, the focus is a few millimeters above the surface of the material, which ensures the best cutting results.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3.To cut:</h3>
Place the prepared acrylic sheet on the working platform of the laser cutting machine and fix it to prevent movement.Start the laser cutting machine to ensure the safety of the operating area and avoid touching the moving laser beam.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">4.Check and clean up:</h3>
After you have finished cutting, check that the cutting edge is smooth and complete.If necessary, clean the cut area with an acrylic cleaner or a mild cleaning cloth to ensure that the surface is dust-free and clean.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Wood：</h3>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Preparation:</h3>
· Ensure that the laser cutting machine is properly installed, calibrated and in good working order.
· Prepare wood suitable for laser cutting, such as sheet wood, plywood or medium density fiberboard (MDF). Make sure the surface of the wood is flat and free of scratches or dirt.
Use vector graphics software (such as Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, etc.) to create or import design files that need to be cut.
· Ensure that the design document is accurate and correctly placed in the working area of the laser cutting machine.
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Set cutting parameters:</h3>
Depending on the type and thickness of wood used, set cutting parameters including power, speed and depth of focus. (Typically, wood cutting requires high power and moderate to fast cutting speeds to ensure clear cutting edges without burning or melting the wood)
