<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Project Overview:</h3>
The smart home control system utilizes Amazon Echo as the **central control device**, and controls and manages various smart home devices through voice commands. Users can use simple voice commands to operate lighting, adjust temperature, manage safety systems, etc., thereby improving the comfort and convenience of the living environment.


<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Project composition:</h3>

**Amazon Echo device:** Provides voice control function as the primary interface for users to interact with smart home systems.


**Smart home devices:** including smart bulbs, smart sockets, smart door locks, smart appliances, etc. These devices connect to the Internet through Wi Fi or other protocols, and can receive and execute commands sent by Echo.


**Cloud services:** Cloud service platforms such as [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.amazonaws.cn/campaign/CloudService/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_CN&sc_publisher=Bing_cn&sc_category=pc&sc_medium=BingCN_%E5%93%81%E7%89%8C_%E5%93%81%E7%89%8C%E8%AF%8D_b&sc_content=%E5%93%81%E7%89%8C%E8%AF%8D_%E5%AE%98%E7%BD%91%2F%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99_%E7%9F%AD&sc_detail=ww.amazon.com&sc_segment=JK-ACTS%20%E5%BF%85%E5%BA%94b5&sc_matchtype=phrase&sc_country=CN&trk=9c8180ac-e11e-4b18-beb8-50d5fd05dbca&s_kwcid=AL!4422!10!73323991366851!73324067065481&ef_id=97d0b53b8fa1129d39d4d341b856199c:G:s) are used to store and process device data, implement voice recognition and response functions.


**Mobile application:** Alexa application or custom mobile application used to manage and configure Echo devices, set user preferences, and interact with smart home devices.
