Proper protective equipment ensures that operators do not come into contact with potentially hazardous objects such as rotating parts and cutting tools. These protective devices may include machine covers, partitions and automatic closing devices.

- With proper design and obvious operation instructions: 
Proper machine design ensures that only those who know how to operate the CNC machine can use it. Clear, visual indication labels and warning messages can also alert operators to safe operations.

- Risk assessment and management: 
Conduct regular risk assessments to identify any possible risks and address them in a timely manner. Develop strict safety procedures and ensure that operators and maintainers follow them.

- Regular maintenance and inspection: 
The CNC machine is regularly maintained and inspected to ensure that it is operating as expected. Any parts that require repair or replacement should be dealt with immediately.

- Emergency treatment: 
there is an emergency stop button or switch to quickly cut off the power supply in case of an emergency.

CNC milling machines (or milling machines) are very similar to CNC milling machines in that they use multi blade cutting tools that rotate relative to the workpiece to create the desired parts. 
- **Application:**
Although CNC milling machines are usually used to **process hard metals and industrial grade materials**, they are more suitable for **cutting soft and delicate materials**, such as **plastic, wood and foam**, and are very suitable for **creating panels, plastic prototypes and molds for injection molding applications**.

### <font size="3"><h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. CNC lathe</h3></font>
CNC turning center, also known as CNC lathe. CNC lathes (or lathes) have similarities with CNC milling machines and milling machines; They have chucks and spindles, and rely on CNC technology. However, the working methods of these machines are completely opposite. On a CNC lathe, the chuck and spindle fix the workpiece onto a fixed cutting tool and rotate it. These machines typically have a 3-axis configuration and can achieve strict tolerances up to ± 4 μ m. 
- **Application:**
They are very suitable for **processing complex cylindrical shapes**. CNC lathes have high-quality turning processes, **including taper turning, hobbing, drilling, cutting, and slotting**. This machine can also **perform reaming, spot facing, spot facing, and thread cutting operations**. But as the workpiece becomes thicker, the accuracy of the CNC lathe will decrease.

### <font size="3"><h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3.CNC laser cutting machine</h3></font>
CNC laser cutting machines are similar to CNC milling machines in terms of their machinable shapes or feature types. A laser beam is a high-intensity beam of light. When focused on the workpiece, it will melt the workpiece until a notch is formed. CNC technology controls the movement sequence of the laser cutting head (and laser beam) until the required customized parts are manufactured.
- **Application:**
 The CNC laser cutting machine has a **high level of cutting accuracy** and is very suitable for **cutting various materials**, including **metal, plastic, and hardwood**. In addition, their extremely high precision makes them very suitable for ****machining brand name and logo into CNC milling or turning parts**.

CNC water jet cutting machines use high-pressure water jets (or mixtures of water and abrasive materials) to cut materials. Computer CNC technology controls the movement sequence of water jets to create the required finished parts.
CNC water jet cutting machines are very similar to CNC plasma and laser cutting machines because they do not require machine tools. 
- **Application:**
Unlike CNC plasma and laser cutting machines, CNC water jet cutting machines are particularly suitable for 
**processing low thermal resistance materials such as aluminum and plastics**. "Low thermal resistance" refers to the easy melting of materials when exposed to high temperatures.
