<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Basic operation</h3>

- Operator training: 
Operators are required to receive comprehensive training, including understanding and writing CNC code, operating and setting up machines, and basic machine maintenance. They also need to know what safe steps are and how to deal with potential problems.

- Protective equipment: 
Proper protective equipment ensures that operators do not come into contact with potentially hazardous objects such as rotating parts and cutting tools. These protective devices may include machine covers, partitions and automatic closing devices.

- With proper design and obvious operation instructions: 
Proper machine design ensures that only those who know how to operate the CNC machine can use it. Clear, visual indication labels and warning messages can also alert operators to safe operations.

- Risk assessment and management: 
Conduct regular risk assessments to identify any possible risks and address them in a timely manner. Develop strict safety procedures and ensure that operators and maintainers follow them.

- Regular maintenance and inspection: 
The CNC machine is regularly maintained and inspected to ensure that it is operating as expected. Any parts that require repair or replacement should be dealt with immediately.

- Emergency treatment: 
there is an emergency stop button or switch to quickly cut off the power supply in case of an emergency.

1. must have a comprehensive understanding of the machine, mechanical properties and transmission system principle, power supply device, certificate to work.
2. every day before work operation, start the machine tool to run at low speed for 5 minutes empty operation, start the production point check, fill in the "equipment point check table" content, check whether the machine tool parts are normal.
3. check the wear, tie the cuffs, wear glasses, do not wear gloves operation, girls need to put the hair on the job with a good cap to avoid accidents.
4. before starting, remove the obstacles and measuring tools on the guide rail and sliding surface, and remove the clamping tool in time. Check whether the mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic and other operating handles, valves, switches, etc. are in the non-working position, and check whether the tool holder is in the non-working position. Check whether the oil in the box is within the specified scale range, and refuel according to the lubrication chart or instructions.
5. turn on and off in order, start the machine tool and then turn on the CNC system, turn off the CNC system and then turn off the machine tool.
6. the correct tool, determine the workpiece coordinate system, and check the data.
7. the program should be carefully checked after input, including the code, instructions, addresses, values, signs, decimal points and grammar check, to ensure correct.
8, after debugging the program, before the formal cutting, check the program, tools, fixtures, workpieces, parameters, etc., are positive
True.
9. the tool compensation value input, to the knife complement, compensation value, positive and negative signs, decimal point carefully check.
10, according to the process and procedure requirements clamping tool. Before the execution of formal processing, the input program and parameters should be carefully checked, and the program trial run should be carried out to prevent the collision between the tool and the workpiece during processing and damage to the machine tool and the tool.
11, according to the procedure, according to the process of processing, it is strictly prohibited to increase the amount of feed, cutting speed and cutting depth, it is strictly prohibited to use the machine tool with overload and super performance range, it is strictly prohibited to operate in violation of regulations, and it is not allowed to use the precision machine tool for rough machining. The tool should be kept sharp, the knife is not allowed to stop, and the hydraulic system is not allowed to adjust without permission (except the throttle valve).
12. After sharpening the tool and replacing the tool, the tool length should be re-measured and the tool complement value and the tool complement number should be modified.
13, after the modification of the program, the modified part should be carefully calculated and carefully checked.
14, manual continuous feed operation, you must check whether the position selected by the various switches is correct, determine the positive and negative direction, and then operate.
15. Let the machine run empty for more than 15 minutes after starting, so that the machine can achieve thermal balance.
16, once abnormal conditions are found in the operation of the machine tool, the red emergency stop button should be immediately pressed to terminate all movements and operations of the machine tool. After the fault is removed, the machine can be operated again and the program can be executed.
17. When the machine tool alarm occurs, the cause should be identified according to the alarm number and eliminated in time.
18. Regularly clean up the iron filings and other debris in the coolant box, and timely supplement the coolant according to the regulations.
19, without the permission of the workshop supervisor, do not insert U (hard) disk, CD into the CNC machine tool, do not modify or delete the process in the machine tool
Order.
20. after work, clean up the site, clean the iron filings of CNC machine tools, wipe the lathe, oil anti-rust, according to the regulations in the refueling part of the oil, the workpiece on the shelf neatly placed, do 5S work.
