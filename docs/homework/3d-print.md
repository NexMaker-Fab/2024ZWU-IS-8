Machine: The variety of 3D printers is also constantly increasing, covering various needs and application scenarios, from household desktop printers to industrial grade large printers. Some advanced industrial grade printers can even use multiple materials and colors to print complex objects.

- SLA (Light Curing): SLA printers use ultraviolet lasers or LED light sources to irradiate photosensitive resins and solidify them layer by layer to construct models.

- DLP (Digital Light Processing): DLP printers are similar to SLA, but use digital light processing technology to illuminate photosensitive resins.

- Multi material/multi color printers: These printers allow the use of multiple materials or colors in a single model, such as by using multiple nozzles or exchanging material spools.

- Metal 3D printer: Metal 3D printers can use various technologies, including SLS, DMLS, EBM (electron beam melting), etc., to sinter metal powder layer by layer into a model.

- Nozzle fusion technology: using powder as raw material and printing through multiple nozzles. The core advantage of this technology lies in the simultaneous application of multiple nozzles during the printing process, greatly improving printing efficiency. MJF technology can also achieve microstructure control of printed objects, providing higher printing quality and greater design freedom.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Postprocess the surface</h2>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Basic steps:</h3>

- This cleaning step can be done manually by soaking the parts in the solution, or by using an automated machine, stirring the liquid for a pre-set time. The simplest and most effective cleaning workflow is detailed below. This step prepares you for secondary processing such as painting, dyeing, smoothing or polishing.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Post-treatment of different materials:</h3>

- PLA: PLA is the most commonly used 3D printing material in home and educational Settings because it is easy to print and environmentally friendly. Post-treatment of PLA may include sanding, painting or coating. However, because PLA is relatively brittle, it is not suitable for excessive polishing.
- ABS: ABS is a more powerful plastic that can withstand more post-processing such as grinding, sanding and painting. Ethyl acetate steam grinding is a common method to give ABS finished products a smooth and shiny surface.
- Nylon: Nylon is a durable and flexible material that is often used in parts that need to withstand stress. Nylon generally needs to be cleaned with alcohol to remove any uncured material and can be sanded and dyed.
- Resin: Photocured resin printing needs to be cleaned (usually with alcohol) and photocured to get the final result. Further sanding and painting may be required for best results.
- Metal: Printing metal parts often requires additional post-processing, including removal of support structures, heat treatment to increase strength, surface grinding, or electrical discharge machining.
