<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1.1 Background of 3D printing technology</h3>

- 3D printing refers to the  process of manufacturing parts or objects through material stacking using print heads, nozzles, or other printing techniques. 

- At present, 3D printing processes that can be used for sports helmet manufacturing technology include fused deposition molding (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), and multi jet fusion (MJF) technologies. The 3D printing manufacturing technology of sports helmets avoids material waste, simplifies manufacturing steps, and achieves personalized and lightweight manufacturing of sports helmets. 

- In the future, with the continuous development of 3D printing technology, the integrated additive manufacturing of personalized and lightweight sports helmets will become possible.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1.3 Existing processing techniques and materials used</h3>

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</h4>

><strong>Introduction:</strong></font>

Fused Deposition Modeling is a cost-effective and widely used 3D printing technology, where filament is continuously fed to the nozzle through an extrusion mechanism and heated. The melted material is then extruded from the nozzle, deposited, and solidifies upon cooling. It is layered according to the designed 3D model.

><strong>Materials Used:</strong></font>

Currently, the more mature FDM soft printing filaments related to sports helmets mainly include Polylactic Acid (PLA), Carbon Fiber, and Polyurethane (TPU).

><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></font>

FDM technology is lightweight and has good impact resistance. However, in FDM, the layers of melted filaments usually have a lower interlayer entanglement network and crystal density than the filament body, introducing weak structures and voids, thus affecting its tensile, compressive, bending, and impact properties related to sports helmets. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the mechanical properties by modifying the printing filament in existing FDM printing technology, making FDM technology more applicable in the field of sports helmets.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</h4>

><strong>Introduction:</strong></font>

Selective Laser Sintering technology uses an infrared laser as the energy source. The laser beam selectively sinters under computer control according to the layer cross-sectional information, melting the adjacent powder. After the irradiation stops, it cools and solidifies into the preset forming surface, layer by layer, to get the preset parts.

><strong>Materials Used:</strong></font>

Currently, the materials suitable for SLS printing sports helmets mainly include thermoplastic polyurethane powder (TPU) and Nylon powder.

><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></font>

SLS technology is simple to operate, has a high success rate, and a high material utilization rate. Each layer of unsintered powder material can be recycled and reused. However, when printing porous structures such as the buffer layer in sports helmets, there are shortcomings such as low density, high surface roughness, and insufficient mechanical properties. Therefore, avoiding sintering defects and improving the forming performance of the corresponding thermoplastic material powder are key points to promote the application of SLS technology in the field of sports helmet manufacturing.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Multi Jet Fusion (MJF)</h4>

><strong>Introduction:</strong></font>

The principle of Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) technology is to first spread a layer of powder, then spray a solvent, and at the same time spray a detail agent to ensure the precision of the printed object's edges. Then a heat source is applied to it, and this layer is considered complete. This process is repeated until the 3D object is completed.

><strong>Materials Used:</strong></font>

Currently, the materials used in the MJF process are mainly nylon (PA) series materials.

><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></font>

Multi Jet Fusion modeling technology has high precision and fast printing speed, which can achieve the goal of rapid prototyping of personalized sports helmets. However, because the equipment is relatively expensive, although it saves the workflow and improves the printing speed and accuracy, it does not reduce the production cost. Therefore, the expansion and improvement of printing materials and the reduction of costs are the key factors in promoting the application of MJF technology in the field of sports helmets.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Postprocess the surface</h2>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Basic steps:</h3>

- This cleaning step can be done manually by soaking the parts in the solution, or by using an automated machine, stirring the liquid for a pre-set time. The simplest and most effective cleaning workflow is detailed below. This step prepares you for secondary processing such as painting, dyeing, smoothing or polishing.

<img src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/e7e202ee94103a6653ed821df57cc3909b0d0a84/images/3dprint/%E6%B8%85%E6%B4%97.gif" width="1200">

- Sanding and polishing: Remove rough surfaces from printed objects for a smooth appearance. Here's the work. Use sandpaper or a grinding wheel. Remember to protect your eyes and skin from damage caused by the tiny particles you sand.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Post-treatment of different materials:</h3>

- PLA: PLA is the most commonly used 3D printing material in home and educational Settings because it is easy to print and environmentally friendly. Post-treatment of PLA may include sanding, painting or coating. However, because PLA is relatively brittle, it is not suitable for excessive polishing.
- ABS: ABS is a more powerful plastic that can withstand more post-processing such as grinding, sanding and painting. Ethyl acetate steam grinding is a common method to give ABS finished products a smooth and shiny surface.
- Nylon: Nylon is a durable and flexible material that is often used in parts that need to withstand stress. Nylon generally needs to be cleaned with alcohol to remove any uncured material and can be sanded and dyed.
- Resin: Photocured resin printing needs to be cleaned (usually with alcohol) and photocured to get the final result. Further sanding and painting may be required for best results.
- Metal: Printing metal parts often requires additional post-processing, including removal of support structures, heat treatment to increase strength, surface grinding, or electrical discharge machining.
