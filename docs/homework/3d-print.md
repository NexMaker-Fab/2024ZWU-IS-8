<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1.3 Existing processing techniques and materials used</h3>



<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</h4>



><strong>Introduction:</strong></font>



Fused Deposition Modeling is a cost-effective and widely used 3D printing technology, where filament is continuously fed to the nozzle through an extrusion mechanism and heated. The melted material is then extruded from the nozzle, deposited, and solidifies upon cooling. It is layered according to the designed 3D model.



><strong>Materials Used:</strong></font>



Currently, the more mature FDM soft printing filaments related to sports helmets mainly include Polylactic Acid (PLA), Carbon Fiber, and Polyurethane (TPU).



><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></font>



FDM technology is lightweight and has good impact resistance. However, in FDM, the layers of melted filaments usually have a lower interlayer entanglement network and crystal density than the filament body, introducing weak structures and voids, thus affecting its tensile, compressive, bending, and impact properties related to sports helmets. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the mechanical properties by modifying the printing filament in existing FDM printing technology, making FDM technology more applicable in the field of sports helmets.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</h4>



><strong>Introduction:</strong></font>



Selective Laser Sintering technology uses an infrared laser as the energy source. The laser beam selectively sinters under computer control according to the layer cross-sectional information, melting the adjacent powder. After the irradiation stops, it cools and solidifies into the preset forming surface, layer by layer, to get the preset parts.



><strong>Materials Used:</strong></font>



Currently, the materials suitable for SLS printing sports helmets mainly include thermoplastic polyurethane powder (TPU) and Nylon powder.



><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></font>



SLS technology is simple to operate, has a high success rate, and a high material utilization rate. Each layer of unsintered powder material can be recycled and reused. However, when printing porous structures such as the buffer layer in sports helmets, there are shortcomings such as low density, high surface roughness, and insufficient mechanical properties. Therefore, avoiding sintering defects and improving the forming performance of the corresponding thermoplastic material powder are key points to promote the application of SLS technology in the field of sports helmet manufacturing.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">Multi Jet Fusion (MJF)</h4>



><strong>Introduction:</strong></font>



The principle of Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) technology is to first spread a layer of powder, then spray a solvent, and at the same time spray a detail agent to ensure the precision of the printed object's edges. Then a heat source is applied to it, and this layer is considered complete. This process is repeated until the 3D object is completed.



><strong>Materials Used:</strong></font>



Currently, the materials used in the MJF process are mainly nylon (PA) series materials.



><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></font>



Multi Jet Fusion modeling technology has high precision and fast printing speed, which can achieve the goal of rapid prototyping of personalized sports helmets. However, because the equipment is relatively expensive, although it saves the workflow and improves the printing speed and accuracy, it does not reduce the production cost. Therefore, the expansion and improvement of printing materials and the reduction of costs are the key factors in promoting the application of MJF technology in the field of sports helmets.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1.5 Post treatment process of materials</h3>



**Customized nylon carbon fiber material**

KAV Sports has partnered with Jabil in Florida, USA to create a bicycle helmet called "KAV Portola" using carbon customized engineering materials and additive manufacturing technology. This helmet is made of **customized nylon carbon fiber material**, which is both hard and tough, flexible enough, and can also adapt to high and low temperatures. In addition to providing excellent energy absorption performance, this material can also increase the adhesion between layers to achieve consistent performance and improve appearance.



**1. Clean the surface** 

Remove any dust or debris that may adhere. You can use soap and water to gently clean and then thoroughly dry.



**2. Polishing:**

Due to the possible roughness of the surface printed on nylon carbon fiber, polishing may be necessary. You can start with wet sandpaper and gradually transition to finer sandpaper. It should be noted that the polishing process will generate dust, so please ensure that it is carried out in a well ventilated area and wear appropriate protective equipment.



**3. Coating:**

By adding coatings to provide additional durability and aesthetics. Various coatings can be used, including varnish, spray paint, or specialized 3D printing coatings. Before coating, ensure that the printed surface is dry, clean, and free of grease.



**4. Hardening:**

 In some cases, heat treatment may be required to harden nylon carbon fiber printed parts. This usually involves placing the printed piece in an oven and heating it at a controlled temperature for a period of time.



**5. Inspection:** 

Finally, make sure to inspect the printed parts to ensure that there are no defects or weaknesses, including checking for any possible cracks, wear, or other damage.
