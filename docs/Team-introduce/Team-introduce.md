<p style="font-size:30px;">Welcome!</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Here is the website of the BUNBUN Group, we are a group of five people with no basic computer knowledge, 
but we are always curious, learning spirit and our own unique personality!</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Let's always keep it enthusiastic !</p>

<h1 style="color: #e19cab;">Team’ name</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Because the five of us are the first time to contact the relevant knowledge of this course, at the beginning all feel stupid, in the Chinese "笨" and BUN pronunciation is similar, so named BUNBUN.</p>




<h1 style="color: #e19cab;">Logo inspiration</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Image design: 

we took the initial letter B of BUNBUN to create a glyph, the rabbit as our main image, because we want to be as keen as the rabbit, no longer stupid.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Color use: 

we use pink and dark blue as the main colors, because there are boys and girls in the team, pink represents girls, blue represents boys.</p>
