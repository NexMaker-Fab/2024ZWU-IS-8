- With the progress of The Times, nowadays young people, especially college students, live under various pressures. They not only have to face the pressure of their studies and attend various training, but also prepare for internships and job hunting. The pressure of life is also difficult to ignore, they have to learn to live independently, adjust interpersonal relationships, and even bear the pressure of life brought by rising prices. In addition, they may also suffer from relationship stress when it comes to intimacy. When it comes to personal image, they may also face face and body pressure, as visual social media and mass media are filled with the pursuit of the perfect body and face. In this environment, they desperately need a way to spread the pressure. This is what we wanted to create, an interactive art installation designed to relieve their inner stress and anxiety and help them find inner peace, thereby preventing and promoting their mental health.
