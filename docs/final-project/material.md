<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Pure Copper Transparent Electric Wire:</h3>

- **Specification:**

2Ã—0.3 square; Length 10m (Wire core material: Tin-plated copper)

- Tin-plated copper wire is made by plating a layer of tin on the surface of the copper wire. This material combines the advantages of copper and tin and has excellent electrical conductivity. The tin layer on its surface can prevent the copper wire from contacting the air, thus preventing oxidation. This makes the life of tin-plated copper wire longer and the performance more stable. And tin is a very stable metal, not easily corroded by acid or alkali. Therefore, tin-plated copper wire has good corrosion resistance in various environments. The tin layer can also improve the welding performance of the copper wire, making welding easier and the connection more solid. At the same time, due to the protection of the tin layer, the tin-plated copper wire can maintain good performance in high temperature, humidity or other harsh environments, thereby extending its service life. 

**Therefore, using pure copper wires can better ensure the safe connection of the entire circuit.**

- Cold-rolled steel is a type of steel processed by cold rolling. Compared with hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel plate has more precise thickness and smoother and more beautiful surface. The cold rolling process increases the hardness of the steel, improves its strength, while reducing its toughness and plasticity. Under this process, cold-rolled steel can be formed by various cold rolling shape machines, producing various complex shapes. However, because the cold rolling process is more complicated than the hot rolling process, the production cost is relatively higher, so the price of cold-rolled steel is usually higher than that of hot-rolled steel. Its good mechanical properties and process performance make it widely used in multiple fields such as automobiles, home appliances, construction, and mechanical manufacturing.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Sensors used in the project</h2>

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Arduino Nano Board</h3>

The Arduino Nano is a compact development board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, similar in functionality to the Arduino Uno but with a smaller size. It is suitable for projects requiring small space or lightweight solutions, such as embedded systems and small robots. The Nano board features multiple digital and analog input/output pins, and can be programmed and powered via a USB interface.



The entire system of our project is connected through the Arduino Nano board.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Sound Sensor</h3>

A sound sensor is used to detect sound intensity or specific frequencies in the environment. Typically, they convert sound waves into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to a control system (such as Arduino) through analog or digital outputs. Sound sensors find wide applications in voice control systems, noise monitoring, sound recognition, and more.



In our project, we use a sound sensor to transmit sound values. By detecting ten samples of sound data, averaging them, and then outputting the value to the Arduino board, we determine the high or low level of the relay. This controls the opening and closing of a motor.



<img src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/3763a91c9a3dbeb75249d278798a3680aa83c5f3/images/FINAL/%E5%A3%B0%E9%9F%B3%E4%BC%A0%E6%84%9F%E5%99%A8.png" width="1200">



<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</h3>

An ultrasonic distance sensor measures the distance to an object by emitting ultrasonic pulses and receiving their echoes. Its operation is similar to that of an ultrasonic rangefinder. In Arduino projects, it is commonly used for distance measurement, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous navigation of small vehicles.



In our project, we use an ultrasonic distance sensor to detect the distance between a participant and a device. By transmitting distance data to the Arduino board, we determine the proximity of the participant to the device. This data is then used to control a WS2812 LED strip: displaying steady blue light when close (<80cm), a color-changing effect in mid-range (80-125cm), and an animated effect with blue LEDs when far (>125cm).

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Single Channel 5V Relay</h3>

A single channel 5V relay is an electrical switch device controlled by an electromagnetic coil. The 5V designation refers to the voltage used to control the relay, typically through digital output pins of Arduino. Relays are used to control high-power devices (such as motors, bulbs, heaters) and enable functions like remote switching or automatic control in Arduino projects.



In our project, the Arduino board controls the relay's high and low level transitions. When the sound threshold is reached, the relay switches to a high level, activating a motor that starts rotating a turntable. Conversely, when the threshold is not met, the motor stops rotating as the relay switches to a low level.
