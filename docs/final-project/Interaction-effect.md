<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Streamers interactive effect</h2>
The motor will drive the streamer to rotate by controlling the wheel. The sound threshold of singing is detected by the sound sensor, and the Arduino will read this value and use it to control the rotation speed of the wheel. The rotation speed of the wheel is controlled by the sound threshold. The larger the threshold, the faster the rotational speed, and vice versa. When people sing or make a sound, the streamer will dance at different speeds according to the threshold feedback of the sound sensor, creating a lively and pleasant atmosphere.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Lights with interactive effects</h2>
On the table in front of the microphone, the ultrasonic distance sensor is set up, and a warning slogan is pasted on the ground (walk around to see the different effects). Through the change of the distance between people and the sensor, the Arduino board is used to read the sensor data, and the data is used to control the flashing frequency of the LED light. The farther the distance is, the faster the flashing speed is. The closer the distance, the reverse.
